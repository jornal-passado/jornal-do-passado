# Jornal do Passado


A quiz mobile game for Android. The goal is to guess the year a given set of headlines were published.

Three newspaper front page headlines from the same year are shown to the player, which tries to guess the correct year and scores according to how close the guess is.

The headlines are collected from an online web repository, arquivo.pt.
